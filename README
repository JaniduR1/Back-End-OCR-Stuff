# OCR System Demo

### WIP

This was the initial steps taken to build my own OCR system however it was put on hold due to it not being time realistic
*See report for more information*

1. Run main.py
2. Press any button until you reach the one with the recognised characters (it should go through the different images as you press any button)
3. Press on one area with a green border around it and then click any button to show just that image
4. Press any button to exit
4. That image will be saved as the new `cropped_image.jpg`
